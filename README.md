## 📡 Network Labs – Practical Networking with Cisco Packet Tracer

### Overview

This repository is a **hands-on networking labs collection** designed to help students and junior network engineers **learn, practice, and master real-world networking concepts** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

The labs focus on **core enterprise networking technologies** such as VLANs, Inter-VLAN Routing, DHCP, NAT, SSH, VTP, and Wireless LAN configurations.
Each lab is built to reflect **real production scenarios**, not just theory.

This project is especially suitable for:

* **CCNA (200-301) candidates**
* Networking students
* Entry-level network engineers
* Self-learners who prefer practice over theory

---

### 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this repository are to:

* Bridge the gap between **theoretical networking concepts** and **practical implementation**
* Provide **step-by-step lab scenarios** that simulate real enterprise networks
* Improve troubleshooting, configuration, and verification skills
* Build confidence working with switches, routers, and wireless networks

---

### 🧪 Lab Topics Covered

This repository includes structured labs covering:

#### 🔀 Switching

* VLAN creation and management
* Access and trunk port configuration
* Inter-VLAN routing using Layer 3 switches
* VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)

#### 🌐 IP Services

* DHCP (Server-based & Router-based)
* NAT configurations:

  * Static NAT
  * Dynamic NAT
  * PAT (Port Address Translation)
* Secure remote access using **SSH**

#### 📶 Wireless Networking

* WLAN basic configuration
* Multi-VLAN wireless environments
* DHCP with wireless clients
* 802.1X authentication
* WLC (Wireless LAN Controller) labs

#### 📘 Learning Resources

* Recommended CCNA books list
* Lab requirements clearly documented for each scenario

---

### 🗂 Repository Structure

Each lab follows a clean and consistent structure:

* **`.pkt` files** → Ready-to-use Packet Tracer labs
* **`requirements.txt`** → Lab objectives and configuration tasks
* **Images (PNG/JPG)** → Network topology references (where applicable)

This makes the labs easy to understand, follow, and reproduce.
